#Module 6 Challenge

The file "WeatherPy.ipynb" is where you will find my code for the Part 1: WeatherPy challenge. The file "VacationPy.ipyb" is where you will find my work for Part 2: VacationPy. The Images_Folder is the exported figures from the code: scatter plots, linear regression for multiple variables and I've also included screenshots of the hover maps for both the humid heat map and the heat map with hotels. The cities.csv file is the exported cities from the np.random pick in the code.
The code written is based off of the provided starter code. Resources used were both Xpert Assistant and ChatGPT for overall debugging issues.
